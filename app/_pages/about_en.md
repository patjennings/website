My name is Thomas Guesnon, i'm a designer. My work is about solving visual, ergonomic and functional problems on digital applications. It helps people using products by giving them comfort and efficiency.

I use my skills to design web or native applications, create prototypes or video animations, organize information and document design process. I help stakeholders defining a vision for their digital application.

I worked for various fields, such as aeronautical, transport, health, education or automotive.

I have a partnership with <a href="https://www.lesoctetslibres.com/" target="blank">les Octets Libres, a development studio</a>, with whom we imagine and create turnkey digital solutions.
